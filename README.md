# hogwarts_sorting_hat_app

The **_Hogwarts Sorting Hat_** app is a Flutter-based mobile app that mimics the sorting process from Harry Potter. It integrates **API** interactions and employs the **BLoC state management** pattern. The app fetches and displays data from external **APIs**, using **BLoC** for structured state management and business logic. This project showcases how to integrate external data sources and manage state effectively in a cross-platform mobile application.
